//: ## Defining Strings
//: In the previous playground, you declared number constants like this:
let heightInCentimeters = 7817
//: To declare a string constant, you put text between quotation marks like this:
let favoriteBook = "The Sun Also Rises"

let traditionalGreeting = "Hello, world!"
//: The declared string values also appear in the results sidebar. ðŸ‘‰
//: - experiment: Practice by declaring `favoriteMovie` and `favoriteSong` string constants for your favorite movie and song:
// Declare a favoriteMovie constant
let favoriteMovie = "Forrest Gump"

// Declare a favoriteSong constant
let favoriteSong = "Wake me up when September ends"

//: Next, take a string-based trip around the world.
